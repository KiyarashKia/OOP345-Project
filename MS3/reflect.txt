This milestone was an opportunity for me to go through some concepts we had during the semester, 
and also some exploration I had to go for out of that as each phase brought its unique set of challenges.
Starting with MS1, the focus was on the Utils and Station classes. This foundational step was important for parsing input 
files and managing station-specific items, and setting the stage for more complex operations ahead.
MS2 introduced the CustomerORder module. This phase was supposed to expand the project to handle customer orders and managing the
assembly line's inventory items, showing the importance of efficient data management.
And lastly about MS3, we had to integrate everything of Workstation and LineManager modules.
This was to showcase the dynamic movement of orders through the assembly line, with each workstation playing its role in
filling orders. I had challenges to ensure the correct sequence of operations and managing the flow of orders.
Overall, this project was a nice but complex exersice for me in C++, but well organized from basic class structures to STL features,
containers and algorithms. I feel better in problem-solving even I would say.
